### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, this is Tianrui (Eric) Qi, a junior undergraduate at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) (GT) majoring in Computer Science (CS). 
Before joining GT, I studied CS and Mathematics at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) (RPI). My primary interest lies at the crossroads of machine learning (ML) and optics imaging. 
During my time at RPI, I built a strong foundation in statistics and ML under the guidance of [Dr. Wang](https://wang-axis.github.io/). 
Now, in [Dr. Jiaâ€™s lab](https://sites.google.com/site/thejialab/) at GT, Iâ€™m broadening my expertise in imaging technology, such as single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy. 
With a solid base in both the theoretical and practical aspects of my domain, I continue to expand my knowledge tree to Physics right now as my second major at GT. 
I want to pursue a Biomedical Engineering (BME) Ph.D. after my undergraduate studies.
